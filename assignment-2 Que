Assignment 2
1. Write a program to print the following number pattern using a loop.
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
(If the user entered 10 the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10))
3. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
that satisfy the following conditions
1. The number must be divisible by five
2. If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
3. If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
4. Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.
(The number is 75869, so the output should be 5.)
5. Write a program to print list [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] in reverse order using a loop
6. Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
7. Write a program to print prime numbers between 1 and 100
8. Write a program to print Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
(For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
9. Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.
10. Write a program to print reverse a given integer number
